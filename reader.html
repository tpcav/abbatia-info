  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Consisting of Jazz Vicaris, Syd Solanke, & Droogie</p>
  <p><a href="https://linktr.ee/abbatia">ABBATIA</a> is a 3-piece rap group from Philly, with a hardcore hip-hop sound reminiscent of City Morgue, Death Grips, Ho99o9 but with pop-leaning tracks that have been described as “horror-core Outkast”.</p>
  <p>The guys are lifelong best friends in their early 20s, bonded by a love for diverse genres of music, manga / anime, sci-fi, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creepypasta">creepypasta.</a></p>
  
  <h2>Production</h2>
  <p>100% of the music production and visuals are done in-house by Syd and Droogie (respectively). Droogie, who handles the visuals, has also done animation and live visuals for artists like Toro y Moi and Daedelus.</p>
  
  <h2>Recent Updates</h2>
  <p>Their next 6-song EP, Red Room, is out in September on <a href="https://a2b2.org/">A2B2</a> - a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/a2b2records/">label</a> recently launched by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andy_morin/">Andy Morin</a>(Flatlander of Death Grips). ABBATIA is the label's 2nd signing. Andy discovered them in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/a2b2">A2B2 Discord</a> community and quickly became addicted to bumping their tracks while driving through LA.</p>
  
  <h2>New EP</h2>
  <p>Standout tracks from the EP include the mosh-pit-inducing “Dreadnaught”; the creepy, face-melting “World Wide Web”, and the ghostly club pop track “System Failure”. These 3 tracks can be found <a href="#">here.</a></p>
